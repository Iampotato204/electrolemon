# About program
Simulates movement of charged particle between plates of charged flat capacitor.

Created using QT (https://www.qt.io/). <br>
Originally intended for Linux, may not work for Windows or MacOS.

Automatically translates to RU/UA, if it is system language. Otherwise, EN is used

When I don't forget, I contribute already-built program here: https://github.com/Iampotato204/electrolemon_build/tree/master <br>
Don't forget about .qm files!! (look at https://github.com/Iampotato204/electrolemon#how-to-run-program)

# Documentation (to be added)
Documentation lies in 'doc' folder. To open it, open 'doc/html' and run 'index.html'.

# How to run program:
- download source code 
- install libraries (I could miss few, or add unrequired): <br>
qtbase5* qt5-qmake qtcreator* qtlocation5* qttools5-dev* qtwayland5 qtwebengine5-dev make cmake gcc mesa-utils freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev libglew-dev
- build project
- put .qm files in build directory, if you want program to be translated (ru&ua supported, +en as default)
