# About program
Simulates movement of charged particle...

Created using QT (https://www.qt.io/). <br>
Originally created for Linux, may or may not work on Windows or MacOS.

When I don't forget, I push already-built program here: https://github.com/Iampotato204/electrolemon_build/ <br>

# Documentation (to be added)
Documentation lies in 'doc' folder. To open it, open 'doc/html' and run 'index.html'.

# How to run program:
- download source code (https://github.com/Iampotato204/electrolemon/)
- install libraries (I could miss few, or add unrequired): <br>
(UPD: essentially, you have install QT framework, resulting libraries may vary)
qtbase5* qt5-qmake qtcreator* qtlocation5* qttools5-dev* qtwayland5 qtwebengine5-dev make cmake gcc mesa-utils freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev libglew-dev
- build project using QT Editor

# Alternative way to run:
- clone pre-built repo (https://github.com/Iampotato204/electrolemon_build/) (could be outdated!!)
- change file permissions of "electrolemon" ELF file to be able to run it
- execute it from your FM or directly from terminal (same as all GUI apps, works bad with tiling window manager)
